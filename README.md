# PlotlyTest
This file contains the code for my Plotly test. The data is from my paper about how the U.S. tends to get involved in international conflicts more often when its government is united, meaning that a singal party control the House, Senate, and Presidency. The figure shows that 8 of the 9 internstate wars with at least 1,000 U.S. battle deaths started under united government, even though the U.S. has only been united for about half its history.
